# Hints for Exercise 5
Below are some tips for working on Exercise 5.
Each section contains some practical tips for the different parts of the exercise, and we have included some pseudocode for Parts 1 and 2 to help guide you in writing your code.
As a reminder, pseudocode is simply an explanation of what the code should do in plain English (or your language of choice).

## Part 1 - Reading and dividing the data file
### Pseudocode
1. Open the `816295.csv` data file for reading.
2. Read the values into a list where each list entry is one line of the file.
3. Loop over all lines in the resulting list (excluding the header). For each line:
  - Split the line into a list of values using the commas.
  - Extract the value for the year using the list item containing the date in the split line list above.
  - Create a varaible that is contains a character string of the name of the output file for that year (e.g., `"AA-1926.csv"`).
  - Open the file named above for appending.
  - Write the entire line to that data file.

### Practical tips
1. **Extracting the year for each line of the data file**.
In order to isolate the year when processing the data in the data file for this exercise, you need to use a substring, or part of a character string, from the values in column 6 of the `816295.csv` data file.
Those values have the form `YYYYMMDD` where `YYYY` is the year of the observation, `MM` is the month, and `DD` is the day.
You want to use only the year, and let's assume that for each line of the data file that is read, you assign the value in column 6 to a variable `date`.
The year part of `date` would then just be the first 4 characters in `date`, and since character strings are simply a list of characters, you can use the index values to extract a slice (or substring) from the variable `date`.
Since the first number in the year in `date` would simply be `date[0]`, and the last would be `date[3]`, all we need is a way to use only index values 0-3 in date.
You can access a range of index values in a string variable or list using the colon (`:`) character.
The example below may help make things more clear:

    ```python
    >>> text = "Helsinki"
    >>> print(text[0])
    'H'
    >>> print(text[3])
    's'
    >>> print(text[0:3]
    'Hel'
    ```
**Note**: Like the `range()` function, the last index value given in a range of values is not included in the list of indices.
2. **Skipping header lines when looping over file data**.
Just a reminder that we showed how to skip over a set number of header lines when reading a file in [this week's lesson](reading-data-from-file.md#headers-of-a-known-number-of-lines).
3. **Changing file names for different years**.
If you are in a loop in which your script is determining the year of a given temperature observation, you will likely also want to automatically have the file name used for reading or writing change for different years.
This is fairly simple.
Let's say you have a variable `year` used to store the year.
If `year` is a numerical value, you will need to convert it to a character string.
We saw how to do this in [Exercise 3](https://github.com/Python-for-geo-people/Exercise-3), for example.
Once `year` is a character string, you can simply add the parts of the file name that come before and after the year together using the math operator `+` to change the file name.

## Part 2 - Calculating annual summer and winter temperatures
### Pseudocode
1. Create a list of names of all of the files generated in Part 1.
2. Loop over that list. For each file:
  - Open the file for reading.
  - Create two empty lists for storing the daily temperatures for summer and winter.
  - Loop over every line in each file. For each line:
    - Split the line into a list of values using the commas.
    - Extract the value for the month using the list item containing the date in the split line list above.
    - Check to see if the month is a summer or winter month. If so, append the temperature to the corresponding temperature list.
  - After checking all lines, calculate the average summer and winter temperatures.
  - Open the summer and winter average temperature files for appending.
  - Append the year and average temperature.

### Practical tips
1. **Calculating the average value of list values**.
It is fairly easy to calculate the average value of a set of numbers in a list, provided the values are in fact stored as data type `float` or `int`, and not stored as type `str`.
If the values in the list are character string values (type `str`), they will need to be converted to `float` values first, using the `float()` function.
You can check `help(float)` for how it works.
Once the list values are of type `float`, they can be summed using the `sum()` function and dividing the sum by the length of the list will give the average value.
2. **Limiting the number of decimal places written to numerical values in a file**.
When you write floating point values to a file it is often nice to specify the number of decimal places for the representation of the values.
This can be done using the `.format()` method for character strings.
It is perhaps easiest to see how this works with an example:

    ```python
    >>> number = 1.234556789
    >>> print(number)
    1.234556789
    >>> print( "{0:.3f}".format(number) )
    1.235
    >>> print( "{0:.1f}".format(number) )
    1.2
    >>> print( "The rounded value of number is {0:.4f} when rounded to 4 decimal places".format(number) )
    The rounded value of number is 1.2346 when rounded to 4 decimal places
    ```
OK, so what does this all mean?
Well, there's a few things we can say.
  - The `.format()` method must be used on a character string, and the variable (or variables) within the parentheses is the value that will be formatted (`number` in this case).
  - The stuff in the curly brackets `{` and `}` is used to indicate a value that should be modified by the `.format()` method.
  Keep in mind that those curly brackets should be in a character string (i.e., enclosed in quotation marks `'` or `"`.
  - The `0` is used to indicate which item in the list of variables should be formatted, like an index value. If there was a second value given in the `.format()` method's list of arguments, its index would be `1`.
  - The `:f` is used to specify that the value in the `.format()` method's parentheses should be formatted as a floating point value.
  - The `.3`, `.1`, and `.4` are the number of decimal places.
This should hopefully help when you write out your average summer and winter temperature values.

## Part 3 - Saving your seasonal average files to GitHub
### Practical tips
1. **Check your files before uploading them to GitHub**.
Just a suggestion here.
You should take a look at the values in your data files before you upload them to make sure the values look reasonable.
The temperature values are in Fahrenheit.
Feel free to convert them to Celsius, but make a note that the temperatures are in Celsius when you commit the files.
