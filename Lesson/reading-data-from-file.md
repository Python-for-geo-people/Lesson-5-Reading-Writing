# Reading data from a file
Our first task in this week's lesson is to learn how to read data from files.
In Python this comprises two tasks: (1) Opening the file to be able to read in the contents, and (2) reading in the contents of the file.
In terms of how the data is read in Python, there are many and we will focus on one simple form.
Later in the course you will be introduced to more sophisticated libraries that can help with reading data files, but for now we will focus on the traditional way in which data files can be read in Python.

The data used in this part of the exercise is from the [Smithsonian Institution's volcano database](http://volcano.si.edu/).

6. [Pro tips](#pro-tips)

## Downloading and extracting the data
1. You can start by downloading the [volcano data zip file](https://github.com/Python-for-geo-people/Lesson-5-Reading-Writing/raw/master/Data/volcano-data.zip) we will be using for this part of the lesson.
  - The Firefox browser will likely download the file to the `Downloads` directory in the home directory of your computer instance.
  If so, you should move the file into the home directory using the file browser.
2. Once you have moved the `volcano-data.zip` file into your home directory, you can unzip the file using the `unzip` command in the Terminal window.

    ```bash
    $ cd $HOME
    $ unzip volcano-data.zip
    $ ls volcano-data
    GVP-Volcano-Lat-Lon-Elev.csv GVP-Volcano-List.csv
    ```
You should now have a directory titled `volcano-data` in your home directory.
It contains two files based on [version 4.5.1 of the Smithsonian Institution's Holocene volcano database (updated 23.9.2016)](http://volcano.si.edu/list_volcano_holocene.cfm):
  - `GVP-Volcano-List.csv`: The first 100 lines of the Holocene volcano database file in `.csv` format and with header lines.
  **Note**: Values are separated by semicolons (`;`) in this version of the file rather than commas (`,`).
  - `GVP-Volcano-Lat-Lon-Elev.csv`: The volcano ID, latitude, longitude and elevation for the first 10 volcanoes in the Holocene volcano database.
  There are no headers in this file and values are separated by commas (`,`).

## Preparing to read the data files in **Spyder**
1. Let's start by opening **Spyder** by either double clicking on its icon on the Desktop or typing `spyder` in the Terminal window.
2. In order to use the data in the downloaded files, we need to change the working directory in **Spyder** to be the `volcano-data` directory in your home directory.
This can be done by clicking on the **File explorer** tab in the upper right pane of the **Spyder** window and navigating to the `volcano-data` directory.
3. After navigating to that directory, you should see the two data files. However, you also need to tell the IPython window in **Spyder** that the `volcano-data` directory is where we will be working.
This can be done by clicking on the button shown below to set the console's working directory to the one selected in the **File explorer**.

We should now be ready to continue and start working with our data files.

## Reading an entire file at once
There are several ways in which data can be read from a file in Python, but some are more common (or better in some cases) than others.
We will focus on two ways to read files that can be easily used for many types of data files.

1. We will begin by reading an entire file into a Python list.
To start we need to open the file for reading by typing the following into the **Spyder** editor:

    ```python
    with open("GVP-Volcano-Lat-Lon-Elev.csv", "r") as infile:
        <commands to read file...>
    ```
Here we are using the `open()` function in combination with the `with` statement in Python.
I suppose an explanation is required.
  - The general format used for opening files in Python is `open(<filename>, <mode>)`, where `filename` is the name of the file and `mode` is either `"r"` for reading a file or `"w"` for writing to a file.
  In our case, we open our file (`"GVP-Volcano-Lat-Lon-Elev.csv"`) to be read (`"r"`).
  - In addition, we are using the `with` statement.
  What this does is open our file and assign access to the file to a variable (`infile`).
  Thus, using the variable `infile` we can access the file contents anywhere within the indented block of code beneath the `with` statement.
  For instance, we will see how to read the file in the next point.
  - The main advantage of using the `with` statement is that normally you need to manually close file access in Python (using the `file.close()` method), but when using the `with` statement the file is automatically closed at the end of the indented block.
  This ensures you don't forget to close it yourself.
  Closing files is important because sometimes the final changes made to a file will not be written until the file is closed, for example.
2. With our file open, we can now proceed to read the file.

    ```python
    """
    readall.py
    
    A simple script for reading the entire contents of a file.
    
    dwhipp - 2.10.2016
    """
    
    # Read entire data file
    with open("GVP-Volcano-Lat-Lon-Elev.csv", "r") as infile:
        data = infile.read()
        print(data)
    ```
So what we have done here is to use the `file.read()` *method* to read in the entire file as one long character string.
What does that mean?
Well, this means that we now have a variable `data` that contains the entire contents of our data file (`GVP-Volcano-Lat-Lon-Elev.csv`).
Thus, if we save the script above as `readall.py` and run it in **Spyder**, we should see the following output to the IPython window:

    ```python
    210010,50.17,6.85,600
    210020,45.775,2.97,1464
    210030,42.17,2.53,893
    210040,38.87,-4.02,1117
    211001,43.25,10.87,500
    211003,42.6,11.93,800
    211004,41.73,12.7,949
    211010,40.827,14.139,458
    211020,40.821,14.426,1281
    211030,40.73,13.897,789
    ```
No surprises here, this looks like the contents of the `GVP-Volcano-Lat-Lon-Elev.csv` data file.
If you want to confirm, you're welcome to open that file in the **Spyder** editor.
Note that you may have to set **Files of type** to be "All files (\*)" in the **Open file** window to see the data files.
3. As mentioned, `file.read()` is a *method* for file objects that reads all data in as a single (potentially very long) character string.
You can confirm this using the `type()` function.

    ```python
    >>> type(data)
    str
    ```
Obviously, it is nice to read the entire file at once, but this may be a problem for very large data files that may not fit in memory on the computer.
4. To convert our character string `data` into a more usable format in which each line is a separate value in a Python list, we can use the `str.splitlines()` method.
Thus, we can create a list `datalist` that contains each line of the file as follows:

    ```python
    """
    readall.py
    
    A simple script for reading the entire contents of a file.
    
    dwhipp - 2.10.2016
    """
    
    # Read entire data file, separate lines in a list
    with open("GVP-Volcano-Lat-Lon-Elev.csv", "r") as infile:
        data = infile.read()
        datalist = data.splitlines()
        print(datalist)
    ```
Now each line of the data file will be a character string in the list `datalist`.
We can confirm this by running the example above, which should output the following to the IPython console:

    ```python
    ['210010,50.17,6.85,600', '210020,45.775,2.97,1464', '210030,42.17,2.53,893', '210040,38.87,-4.02,1117', '211001,43.25,10.87,500', '211003,42.6,11.93,800', '211004,41.73,12.7,949', '211010,40.827,14.139,458', '211020,40.821,14.426,1281', '211030,40.73,13.897,789']
    ```
We are now ready to start interacting with our file data.

## Interacting with our file data
We currently have a Python list `datalist` that contains our data file contents.
A common task in Python is to separate the values on each line into separate Python lists that can be manipuated independently.
Below, we will create a set of 4 Python lists, one for each column in our data file, and fill them with the values from the 10 lines of our file.

1. We will first need to create our empty lists for storing the data file values.
We can do this by creating empty lists beneath the indented block for reading the file.

    ```python
    """
    readall.py
    
    A simple script for reading the entire contents of a file.
    
    dwhipp - 2.10.2016
    """

    # Read entire data file, separate lines in a list
    with open("GVP-Volcano-Lat-Lon-Elev.csv", "r") as infile:
        data = infile.read()
        datalist = data.splitlines()

    # Create empty lists to store file data
    VolcanoID = []
    Latitude = []
    Longitude = []
    Elevation = []
    ```
**Note**: These empty lists are not indented as part of the file reading block.
2. With the empty lists created, we now need to go through each line of the file, separate the values on each line, and add them to the lists we've created.
We can do this using the `str.split()` method and a `for` loop.

    ```python
    """
    readall.py
    
    A simple script for reading the entire contents of a file.
    
    dwhipp - 2.10.2016
    """

    # Read entire data file, separate lines in a list
    with open("GVP-Volcano-Lat-Lon-Elev.csv", "r") as infile:
        data = infile.read()
        datalist = data.splitlines()

    # Create empty lists to store file data
    VolcanoID = []
    Latitude = []
    Longitude = []
    Elevation = []

    # Loop over lines in file, append to lists 
    for line in datalist:
        splitline = line.split(",")
        VolcanoID.append(splitline[0])
        Latitude.append(splitline[1])
        Longitude.append(splitline[2])
        Elevation.append(splitline[3])
    ```
So, what happened?
  - First, we have used a `for` loop to go over each value in the list `datalist`, assigning each line to the variable `line` in the loop.
  - Second, we have created a new variable `splitline` that is itself a Python list.
  In this case, `line.split(",")` separates all of the values in the line at each comma (`,`) and stores the split values in a list (`splitline`).
  You can see this list for the final line in the data file by typing `print(splitline)` in the IPython console.
  - Lastly, since each of the four values in each line of the data file have been separated, we can add the values to the lists we've created earlier using the `list.append()` method.
  In this case, we append the corresponding values in the list `splitline` by using their index values.
  This may seem complicated, but if you look at the code line by line, we're not really doing too many new things here.

## Skipping file headers and other unwanted data
In our example above, we had a data file with 10 lines, and each line had 4 values separated by commas.
It is more typical to deal with data files that include *headers*, which describe the data in the file but are not necessarily data that might be manipulated in a Python script.
Often we simply want to ignore these lines when creating variable lists with data to manipulate.
How headers are handled generally falls into two categories.

### Headers of a known number of lines
In many cases, the header in a data file will occupy the top few lines of a data file and we can simply skip over the header by not storing header data in the lists used for other file data.
We can see and example of how to do this by using the other data file for this part of the lesson (`GVP-Volcano-List.csv`).

1. Let's start by editing the `readall.py` script we created above to read the other data file (`GVP-Volcano-List.csv`) and saving the modified file as `headread.py`.

    ```python
    """
    headread.py
    
    A simple script for reading the entire contents of a file and skipping the header.
    
    dwhipp - 2.10.2016
    """

    # Read entire data file, separate lines in a list
    with open("GVP-Volcano-List.csv", "r") as infile:
        data = infile.read()
        datalist = data.splitlines()

    # Create empty lists to store file data
    VolcanoID = []
    Latitude = []
    Longitude = []
    Elevation = []

    # Loop over lines in file, append to lists 
    for line in datalist:
        splitline = line.split(";")
        VolcanoID.append(splitline[0])
        Latitude.append(splitline[8])
        Longitude.append(splitline[9])
        Elevation.append(splitline[10])
    ```
So this looks a bit different than our earlier script.
We've made three significant changes to this point:
  - The script now opens the data file `GVP-Volcano-List.csv`, which contains the first 100 lines of [version 4.5.1 of the Smithsonian Institution's Holocene volcano database (updated 23.9.2016)](http://volcano.si.edu/list_volcano_holocene.cfm).
  - Lines are split using the semicolon (`;`), rather than comma (`,`) since the semicolon is used in this data file.
  - The index values of `splitline` have been changed to reflect the fact that the latitude, longitude, and elevation data are in different locations in this data file.
2. At this point, we know the first two lines of the data file are the header, and these lines should be skipped when filling the lists of the VolcanoID, etc.
We can skip over the header lines by changing the `for` loop used to split each line in the file as follows:

    ```python
    """
    headread.py
    
    A simple script for reading the entire contents of a file and skipping the header.
    
    dwhipp - 2.10.2016
    """

    # Read entire data file, separate lines in a list
    with open("GVP-Volcano-List.csv", "r") as infile:
        data = infile.read()
        datalist = data.splitlines()

    # Create empty lists to store file data
    VolcanoID = []
    Latitude = []
    Longitude = []
    Elevation = []

    # Loop over lines in file, append to lists, skip first 2 lines of file
    for i in range(2,len(datalist)):
        line = datalist[i]
        splitline = line.split(";")
        VolcanoID.append(splitline[0])
        Latitude.append(splitline[8])
        Longitude.append(splitline[9])
        Elevation.append(splitline[10])
    ```
Here we have made two key changes.
  - First, instead of having a `for` loop that loops over each line in `datalist`, we not use the `range()` function to start at line 3 (index 2) and split lines in the file from there to the end of the file, the index value corresponding to the length of the `datalist` list.
  - Second, since we are now using the index variable `i` in the `for` loop, we need to explicitly define the variable `line` for each iteration in the loop.
  In this case, we simply set `line` to be equal to the value at index `i` in the `datalist` list.

### Headers beginning with a certain character
Another common form of file header is one that starts with a specific character, such as `#`.
In this case we don't need to know the number of lines occupied by the header, but simply to ignore any line starting with `#`, for example.

1. We can start by taking a copy of the first example of the `headread.py` script above and saving it as `charheadread.py`.

    ```python
    """
    charheadread.py
    
    A simple script for reading the entire contents of a file and skipping a header starting with
    a specific character.
    
    dwhipp - 2.10.2016
    """

    # Define starting character for headers/comments
    headchar = "#"

    # Read entire data file, separate lines in a list
    with open("GVP-Volcano-List.csv", "r") as infile:
        data = infile.read()
        datalist = data.splitlines()

    # Create empty lists to store file data
    VolcanoID = []
    Latitude = []
    Longitude = []
    Elevation = []

    # Loop over lines in file, append to lists 
    for line in datalist:
        splitline = line.split(";")
        VolcanoID.append(splitline[0])
        Latitude.append(splitline[8])
        Longitude.append(splitline[9])
        Elevation.append(splitline[10])
    ```
Here all we have done is change the documentation string at the top of the script and define the character `headchar` that should be used to identify the start of a header (or comment) line in the data file.
2. Now we can modify the script within the `for` loop for processing the lines of the file to ignore any line starting with `headchar`.

    ```python
    """
    charheadread.py
    
    A simple script for reading the entire contents of a file and skipping a header starting with
    a specific character.
    
    dwhipp - 2.10.2016
    """

    # Define starting character for headers/comments
    headchar = "#"

    # Read entire data file, separate lines in a list
    with open("GVP-Volcano-List.csv", "r") as infile:
        data = infile.read()
        datalist = data.splitlines()

    # Create empty lists to store file data
    VolcanoID = []
    Latitude = []
    Longitude = []
    Elevation = []

    # Loop over lines in file, append to lists 
    for line in datalist:
        # Append data only for lines that do not start with headchar
        if line[0] != headchar:
            splitline = line.split(";")
            VolcanoID.append(splitline[0])
            Latitude.append(splitline[8])
            Longitude.append(splitline[9])
            Elevation.append(splitline[10])
    ```
The change in this case is simple.
We have added an `if` statement to test if the first character of a given line is not equal to `headchar`.
If that condition is met, the line will be processed normally.
In this way, we will simply ignore lines starting with `headchar`.

## Pro tips
### Spliting lines separated by other characters

### Reading an entire file line-by-line
The example we've seen above will work nicely for small files, but often it is easier to read file data line-by-line and not require storing the entire file in memory.
This is particularly beneficial in cases where you extract only a small amount of the data in a file.
Here we'll explore reading data from a file line by line.

We can start by using a similar template to that used earlier for opening a file, but rather than using the `file.read()` method to read the entire file, we will use a `for` loop to go over each line in the file.

```python
"""
readlines.py

A simple script for reading the contents of a file line by line in Python.

dwhipp - 2.10.2016
"""

# Read entire data file, separate lines in a list
with open("GVP-Volcano-Lat-Lon-Elev.csv", "r") as infile:
    datalist = []
    for line in infile:
        datalist.append(line)
```
Here we start by adding a new empty list `datalist` to which we will append each line of the file that is read.
The `for` loop that follows will read each line in the file `infile` and allow us to manipulate them one by one.
In this way we could, for example, split each line as it is read and store only some part of each line in the list `datalist`.
Depending on the size of data you encounter, this may be the only way to handle your datasets.
