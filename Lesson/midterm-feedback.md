# Summary of early course feedback
 
### 1. Is the pace of the lessons too fast, too slow, or about right?

 - Seems to be about right for most of the students. 
 - Too quick for some, too slow for some others.

### 2. Is the content of the lessons too simple, too difficult, or about right?

 - Seems to be about right for many. 
 - Students with earlier programming experience feel it a bit simple. 
 - Some topics have been more challenging than others.  

### 3. Is the content of the exercises too simple, too difficult, or about right?

 - About right for many
 - A bit challenging for some and time consuming (especially Flag exercise was challenging)
 - Too simple for some 
 - The difficult level of the exercises has varied a bit
 - Could be more examples
 - Could be more difficult exercises as optional tasks 

### 4. Which aspect(s) of the course is/are <u>most</u> helpful to you?

 - Lessons
 - Exercises
 - Learning how to do programming (in Python) and how computers work
 - Learning GitHub 

### 5. Which aspect(s) of the course is/are <u>least</u> helpful to you?

 - Mostly everything have been seen as useful
 - Lessons / Practical sessions / going through the basics
 - Using GitHub can be annoying and difficult to find materials

### 6. What suggestions do you have for improving this course?

 - More time to do the exercises (e.g. 4 hour practicals or two 2-hour sessions)
 - Explaining correct answers on Monday / Giving right answers
 - Make it slightly more challenging
 - More instructions for the exercises, more examples, slightly easier exercises
 - *Chat for asking questions from others / teachers*
 - More stuff on Geographical issues
 - Optional more demanding exercise 

### 7. Do you have any other general comments about the course? Comments on things like the computing environment or use of GitHub would be quite helpful!

 - GitHub was first confusing but now I'm getting it!
 - *Why do we need to use computer instances / Pouta environment instead of doing stuff on local computers?*
 - *Why don't we use Moodle instead of GitHub?*
 - *Why isn't this course done as a MOOC?*
 - Give answers to the exercises
 - *More hints about programming practices (run and test your code frequently, don't use spaces in variable names etc.)*
 - *At the end of lesson material page, give link to the next page, previous page, main page*
 - Practicals should be in the same classroom as lectures where there are two screens
